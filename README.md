# SQL_Magic-Python-SQL- In Jupyter Notebook
SQL Magic - Writing both Python annd SQL codes in the same Notebook



 First, install the iPython_SQL library, which allows SQL magic. You can do this by running exclamation pip, install- iPython SQL in a code cell of a notebook. Next to use the SQL Magic in Jupyter Notebook, you need to load the SQL extension using percentage load_ext SQL. Then you can run SQL queries by entering Percentage SQL or Percentage Percentage SQL depending on whether you want to use line or cell magic. Before running the queries however, you need to establish a connection between the SQL server and the SQL Magic module of the notebook. As an example, let us explore the use of SQL Magic with the SQL Lite3 database server. We first need to establish a connection to a database, say HR.db using SQL Lite3. Next, you load the external SQL module using %load_extsql.
